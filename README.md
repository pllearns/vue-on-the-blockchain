[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/pllearns/vue-on-the-blockchain?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

> A Vue.js project that uses the power of Vue with a solidity contract and web3. All we are doing is creating a single interactive component to execute a contract on the ethereum network.

## Getting Started

##### There are instructions to build this app for production, but keep in mind that we wont be pushing this component to production during our walkthrough.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev


# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a walkthrough of this code, please check out the INSTRUCTIONS.md file.
